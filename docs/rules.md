**At a glance:** Compete to locate and capture three hidden charms on a 5x5 lattice  
**Players:** 2 **Playtime:** 5 minutes per round **Ages:** 8+

## **Setup**

| Place the board between the two players, such that each player sits in front of their five sight lines (as shown below). Choose who will be player 1 (blue) and player 2 (brown), and give each player 8 stones of their color. Each player places their 8 stones off of the board. This pile is called their reserve. | Give each player their five sight tiles:• 3 charm tiles, consisting of: • 1 blue sun • 1 brown sun • 1 flower• 2 void tiles  Each player shuffles their sight tiles face-down and places them face-up in their rack, hidden from the other player. |

## **Object of the Game**

To win the most rounds. For standard competition, play until one player's win count exceeds the other's by three. Or, just play as many rounds as you'd like.

## **Gameplay**

Players alternate taking turns, with player 1 (blue) taking the first turn. In subsequent rounds, alternate who takes the first turn (but keep your colors). Each turn, a player chooses exactly one action from the six available. **Note:** unless otherwise specified, actions are performed using a player's own stones.

_See next page for available actions…_

### **Basic Actions**

There are three basic actions for allocating stones between your reserve and the **intersections** in the board's central lattice:

| 1\. Cast: place a reserve stone on an open intersection | 2\. Transfer: move a cast stone to another open intersection | 3\. Recover: return a cast stone to your reserve pile |
| :-----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |

### **Special Actions**

Two powerful actions require the player to sacrifice a stone from their reserve (the sacrificed stone cannot be recovered for the rest of the round):

| 1\. Reveal: place a reserve stone onto the "+" symbol in front of an opponent's sight line. The opponent reveals the corresponding sight tile, placing it face up on the board. | 2\. Swap: place a reserve stone onto any of the twelve "+" symbols at the top of the board, then swap the position of a cast stone with any opponent's cast stone. |

### **Ending the Round (Action)**

**End the round:** instead of taking one of the five preceding actions, announce that you're ending the round (e.g. say "I'm ending it"). Both players place all sight tiles face up on the board and proceed to scoring.

## **Scoring**

Begin scoring after a player ends the round. Calculate each player's points by summing points awarded from charms they captured and subtracting points from voids they revealed, as described below.

**Captured charms:** Each charm belongs to a single lattice intersection. Locate the blue sun charm by tracing from both players' blue sun tiles to the intersection where their sight lines meet. Locate the brown sun and flower charms by similar methods. The image below shows the three locations for an example round:

| For each charm a player has captured (covered with a stone), award that player points as per the table to the right. Each player benefits from capturing any charm, but benefits most from capturing their own sun (+15 points), second most from capturing the flower (+10 points), and least from capturing the opponent's sun (+5 points). | (Points per charm awarded to capturing player) | blue sun | flower | brown sun |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ | --------- |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | player 1 (blue) captures…                      | \+15     | \+10   | \+5       |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | player 2 (brown) captures…                     | \+5      | \+10   | \+15      |

**Revealed voids:** for each void tile revealed, the revealing player (who placed the stone) loses a point.

**Ties and determining a winner:** if a player has more points, they win the round \- if the score is tied, the player who ended the round loses. After adding a victory to the winner's tally, start another round.

| Scoring An Example Round (Based on the Board Depicted Above) In this example round, we first locate the blue sun charm, which is captured by player 2, awarding them \+5 points. Then we locate the brown sun charm, which is uncaptured (awarding no points). Then we locate the flower charm, which is captured by player 1, awarding them \+10 points. Player 1 has revealed one of player 2's voids, so their score drops from 10 to 9 points. The final score is 9 to 5, with player 1 the winner of the round. |

## **Common Clarifications**

1. A player may end the round on any turn, including their first turn.
2. The round does not automatically end when a player runs out of reserve stones. A player without reserve stones can transfer, recover, or end the round.
3. Players may respond to a swap by immediately re-swapping the same two stones, effectively undoing the original swap. This re-swapping may happen any number of times.
4. A player's score for a round may be negative, if they revealed voids and captured no charms.
